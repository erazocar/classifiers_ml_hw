# Classifiers
This repo serves for the usage of ML classifiers for multiple data types
# Input Files
Please change the name of the path directories in which the data and the models can be saved. This are the variables named "path#". The docs should be found in a local directory called docs.
# Libraries
Please install libraries required for the Python program to run. In case there is a problem, a google colab link has been provided inside the code for usage online. It is linked to an open drive that contains the data used for the analysis. Would require a google account to access it but is open to anyone.
# Code Description
function reader1,2 = reads data from txt files.

function training_KNN = trains K-nearest neighbors models.

function training_NB = trains Naive Bayes multinomial models.

function feature_conversion = transformaiton of features into sparse data. Takes around 4 min to run.
